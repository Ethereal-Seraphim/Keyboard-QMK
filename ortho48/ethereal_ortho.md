For the ortho keyboard I have a few ideas in mind, and I want to try and docmuent them all here so I know what I was thinking later.

First layer (layer 0) has a few interesing features.
Capslock key is rebound to a dual ctrl-esc key for vimcraft.
The backglow button they had is worthless to me, I'm replacing it with a layer 3, which will more than likely become my gui/nav layer.
The arrow keys on the layer are suspect, as I'd rather just use the gui/nav layer.

Layer 1 is my symbol layer.
The idea is entirley taken from:
https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/ergodox-ez/layouts/ZqR6/latest/1
It's sort of a mess and is entirely subject to change.
But it seems like it has every symbol needed on the board, and familiarity/comfort with the layer could prove incredibly useful.
There's a blank spot in the middle of the board over the left paren, that will be Ae when I figure out how to make it so.
I'm currently not happy with the volume options, as I think they should go on the gui/nav layer.

Layer 2 is my hexadecimal numpad layer.
A good chunk of the layout is based off of this:

The design is largely inspired by the ipv6 buddy. I tried to implement everything you'd need for working heavily with numbers.
Primarily it looks like a number pad on the right side, with a bunch of symbols jammed where they fit logically.
Then there's the symbols jammed there that make 0 sense, but you have to work with the confines of the board.
The letters let you input hexcodes if that's something you want to do. I also added a colon for ip/mac addresses and stuff like that.
I'm going to look into better places for enter, tab, and bkspc since I want the layer to be functional all on it's own.

Nav Layer
This one is still being workshopped
I'm definitely going to incorporate vim style hjkl navigational bindings
home, page up, page down, and end should probably be here
Still unsure if I want to add gui/mouse controls here
Macros that work i3wm are also a total possibility here
I also need to decide if this is where my function keys are going
Also my media controls I guess
